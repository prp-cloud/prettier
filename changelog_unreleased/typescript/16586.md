#### Don't print an extra line break for arrow function with type parameter in assignment (#16586 by @sosukesuzuki)

There was a bug where an extra line was inserted when assigning a chained arrow function with type parameters to a variable if there was a line comment above it.

This change ensures that the extra line is no longer inserted.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
// Input
const foo1 = 
  // comment
  <T,>() => () => 1;

// Prettier stable
const foo1 =
  // comment

    <T,>() =>
    () =>
      1;

// Prettier main
const foo1 =
  // comment
  <T,>() =>
    () =>
      1;
```
