#### Preserve a comment between modifier and the decorated property name (#16578 by @sosukesuzuki)

There was a bug where block comments between the modifier and the name of a decorated property were being treated as trailing comments of the decorator. This behavior was not only unexpected but also lacked idempotency.

With this change, the position of the block comment between the modifier and the property name is preserved.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```tsx
// Input
class Foo {
  @decorator
  readonly /* comment */ propertyName;
}

// Prettier stable
class Foo {
  @decorator /* comment */
  readonly propertyName;
}

// Prettier stable (second output)
class Foo {
  @decorator /* comment */ readonly propertyName;
}

// Prettier main
class Foo {
  @decorator
  readonly /* comment */ propertyName;
}
```
