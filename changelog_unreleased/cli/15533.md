#### Skip explicitly passed symbolic links with `--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern` (#15533 by @sanmai-NL)

Since Prettier v3, we stopped following symbolic links, however in some use cases, the symbolic link patterns can't be filtered out, and there is no way to prevent Prettier from throwing errors.

In Prettier main, you can use `--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern` to simply skip symbolic links.
