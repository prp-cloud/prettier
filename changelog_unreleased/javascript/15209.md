#### Avoid introducing linebreaks in template interpolations (#15209 by @bakkot)

In a template string like

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
`this is a long message which contains an interpolation: ${format(data)} <- like this`;
```

avoid adding a linebreak when formatting the expression unless one is already present or it's unavoidable due to e.g. a nested function. Previously a linebreak could be introduced whenever some interpolation in the template was sufficiently "not simple":

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
`this is a long message which contains an interpolation: ${format(
  data,
)} <- like this`;
```

Now it will instead be left alone.

If a linebreak is already present within the `${...}`, format as normal.
