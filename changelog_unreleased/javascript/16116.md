#### Allow linebreaks in member expressions in template interpolations (#16116 by @bakkot)

When there is already a linebreak in a template interpolation, allow it to stay there even if it is a member expression. Note that (as of [#15209](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/15209)) Prettier will not insert a linebreak inside an interpolation when one is not already present.

```jsx
// Input
`template with ${
    very.very.very.very.very.very.very.very.very.very.very.long.chain
}`;

// Prettier stable
`template with ${very.very.very.very.very.very.very.very.very.very.very.long.chain}`;

// Prettier main
`template with ${
  very.very.very.very.very.very.very.very.very.very.very.long.chain
}`;
```
