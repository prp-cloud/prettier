#### Fix false claim in docs that cursorOffset is incompatible with rangeStart/rangeEnd (#15750 by @ExplodingCabbage)

The cursorOffset option has in fact been compatible with rangeStart/rangeEnd for over 5 years, thanks to work by @ds300. However, Prettier's documentation (including the CLI `--help` text) continued to claim otherwise, falsely. The documentation is now fixed.
